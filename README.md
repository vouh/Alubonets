## How authentication works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Reg[Public Auth modal / Google] --> Pending[User PENDING]
  Pending --> Approve[Admin Approvals]
  Approve -->|approve| Active[ACTIVE + role]
  Approve -->|reject| Inactive[INACTIVE]
  Active --> Dash[Role home dashboard]
  Suspend[Admin suspend] --> Blocked[SUSPENDED — no login]
```

1. **Register** only on the public Auth modal (or Google). Creates Supabase Auth user + Prisma `users` row with `status = PENDING`, `role = MEMBER`.
2. **Admin** opens `/admin/approvals` → approve (`ACTIVE`) or reject (`INACTIVE`). Metadata syncs to JWT.
3. **Login** (`/login` or `/admin/login`) uses `signInWithPassword`. Staff admin login has **no** Google button and **no** register.
4. Middleware reads JWT `app_metadata`: `{ role, status, isSuperAdmin, dashboardAccess }` — no Prisma on the Edge.
5. **PENDING** → `/pending` (can still open `/profile`). **SUSPENDED** → signed out with: *“Your account has been temporarily suspended. Please contact the group administrator.”*
6. **Google:** Auth modal → Supabase OAuth → `/auth/callback` upserts Prisma user and redirects to `/pending` or role home.

### Roles and access

| Actor | Approve members | Set EXEC…MEMBER | Set ADMIN | Super Admin flag | Suspend Admins |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Super Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (keep ≥1) | Yes |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | No | No | Non-admins only |
| Others | No | No | No | No | No |

- **Primary `role`** → home path (`ROLE_HOME`): `/admin`, `/dashboard/executive`, … `/dashboard/member`.
- **`dashboardAccess`** → optional extra workspaces; **Workspace** switcher in the dashboard header.
- **Super Admin** always sees every dashboard.
- Shared **profile:** `/profile` for every signed-in user (members and management).

## How contributions and payments work

### Manual / CSV (treasurer)

1. Treasurer records a contribution (member, amount, method, optional M-Pesa ref) or uploads CSV (`email, amount, …`).
2. Prisma creates a `contributions` row.
3. Optional Resend receipt email when configured.
4. Member or treasurer downloads **PDF receipt:** `/api/pdf/receipt/[contributionId]`.
5. Member **statement PDF:** `/api/pdf/statement/[userId]` (own history).

### M-Pesa STK Push

1. Treasurer (or allowed role) submits phone + amount via STK form → `POST /api/mpesa/stk`.
2. Daraja sends prompt to the phone; checkout request id is stored for matching (audit / meta).
3. Safaricom calls `POST /api/mpesa/callback` on success/failure.
4. On success the app creates/links a `Contribution` (amount, `mpesaRef`, method `MPESA`).
5. Receipt PDF uses the same contribution row as cash/bank payments.

Without Daraja env vars, STK stays inactive; the rest of finance still works.

## How PDFs and Word exports work

| Output | Route / entry | Built with |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Contribution receipt | `/api/pdf/receipt/[id]` | pdf-lib — group header, member, amount, date, refs |
| Member statement | `/api/pdf/statement/[userId]` | pdf-lib — contribution list for that member |
| Meeting pack | `/api/export/meetings` | docx — title, date, attendance, agenda, minutes |
| Meeting minutes PDF | `/api/pdf/minutes/[id]` | pdf-lib — letterhead from DB text; publish stores copy in `documents` bucket |

Auth checks ensure members only get their own receipts/statements unless staff.

---

## How dashboards work

Each role has an overview plus section pages (nav in `lib/dashboard/nav.ts`):

| Area | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Admin | KPIs, members directory, approvals, roles & dashboard access, gallery queue, suspend/restore |
| Executive | Projects, announcements, contribution charts |
| Treasurer | Contributions, welfare reviews, CSV, M-Pesa STK |
| Secretary | Announcements, meetings, documents |
| Organizer | Events, gallery, projects |
| Member | Own contributions, welfare requests, live announcements |

Charts are server-aggregated (Prisma) and rendered with Chart.js. Announcements on the member home can update via Supabase Realtime when enabled.

---

## How email works

`lib/email/resend.ts` sends when `RESEND_API_KEY` + `FROM_EMAIL` are set. Typical triggers: membership approved, contribution/welfare notices. Sends are logged in `email_logs` when the app records them. Missing keys → no-op (no crash).

---

## How gallery and storage work

1. Organizer/member adds photo metadata (URL today; Storage bucket `gallery` for uploads when wired).
2. Unpublished photos sit in the admin **gallery queue** (`isPublic = false`).
3. Admin publishes → `isPublic = true` → public gallery.
4. Bucket `documents` is private (secretary/admin upload; members via signed URLs / app links).

SQL for buckets: `supabase/storage.sql`.

## Decisions still with the group

1. Hosting domain (recommend Vercel + Supabase).  
2. Official domain name.  
3. M-Pesa Paybill/Till details.  
4. Commercial terms in the Solution Design Document.
